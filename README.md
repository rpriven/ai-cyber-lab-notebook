Welcome! This repo is my personal learning journal, lab notebook, and idea dump as I explore offensive AI security, red teaming LLMs, and practical pentesting.

Iâ€™m currently working through hands-on labs, certifications, and personal projects related to:
- AI Red Teaming (LLM abuse, prompt injection, adversarial ML)
- Traditional Pentesting (PNPT, CRTO, PJPT)
- Cloud & Security Foundations (Sec+, AZ-900)
